# TIY-Assignments
Reading JavaScript** -- Explain and provide examples for:
~ Basic Literal Types:
null. Intentionally empty value. 1 value.
null+1
=> 1
null-1
=> -1
1/null
=> Infinity

 `Boolean`. 2 possible values. true/false.
Boolean(3>4)
=> false
Boolean(3/5)
=> true
Boolean("less">"much more")
=> false

 `Number`.Multiple values. Whole numbers are integers. In JavaScript all numbers are decimals.
Number(5)
=> 5
5*7
=> 35
3+4
=> 7

`String`. Multiple values. It is a sequence of characters or data type. It is enclosed in quotes.
"my secret closed"
=> 'my secret closed'
Boolean("string")
=> true
"I "+"like "+"my class"
=> 'I like my class'

~ Basic Operators:
Arithmetic. (+ addit.,- subt.,* multip.,/ divis.,% remain).They can be used with number and + with strings (concatenation)
3+3
=> 6
27/6
=> 4.5
34%27
=> 7

 Comparison. (== equal,!= not equal,>bigger,< smaller,>=bigger or equal,<= smaller or equal,!==not precisely equal,=== precisely equal)
4!=4
=> false
Boolean("magic"==='magic')
=> true

 Assignment. =. It assigns values to a labels.
var food="apples"
food
=> 'apples'
var drink="lemonade"
drink
=> 'lemonade'
food+drink
=> 'appleslemonade

~ Built-in Constants:
undefined. Absence of a meaningful value.

 `NaN`. Not a Number. It has no meaningful result.
food/drink
=> NaN
Infinity-Infinity
=> NaN
0/0
=> NaN
`Infinity`.Numbers with no end. Unlimited number of characters.
any number / 0 gives you Infinity
