/* This is what I see:
Differences between these two .html files.
The one without JavaScript is not interactive. It doesn't have any
movement or changing colors.
The accordion is not working (opem/close), it is completely expanded.
The arrows are not interactive in terms of moving or changing colors
either.

Like we just deleted and changed the <script> information,
that gives me the idea of movement and changing colors are
effects inside this part of the code.
