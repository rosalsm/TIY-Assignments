{} as a block operator

The curly bracket delimit the block statement. Example:

if (A==="zero", B==="nine"){

return 9;
}

if...else statement

The IF statement is used to execute an statement if the logical condition is true.

The ELSE statement is used to execute if the logical condition is false.

if ("word"==="blue"){

return 1;
} else {

return 0;
}

Loops.

Loops give you the option to do the same operation several times in just one statement.

for

For loops repeats the statement until condition is false.

for (initial expression;condition;increment expression){

statement;
}

Initial expression, if there is one, initializes the loop and it could be a variable or any degree of complexity.

Condition, while the condition is true the statement is executed. When the condition is false, the loop finishes.

Increment expression, if there is one, affects initial expression for step 2.

while

The statement is executed as long as the condition is true. If condition is false, statement is not executed.

while (condition){

statement;

}

n++ increment the value of n in 1 everytime. x += n increment the value of x in n.

do...while

Statement is repeated until condition is false. The condition is checked at the end of the execution (opposite than while loops).

do{

statement;

} while (condition);
